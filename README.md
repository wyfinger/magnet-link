# magnet-link
A small static site that does not do anything except for the creation of a magnet-link to torrents, using a hash from the address bar for this. It is necessary, to separate these links on Twitter, for example.

For example: http://magnet-link.info/?59066769b9ad42da2e508611c33d7c4480b3857b
